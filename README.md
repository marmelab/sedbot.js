# What's Sedy
Sedy is a GitHub webhook which allows pull-request reviewers to fix typos themselves by typing sed-like commands on review comments.

Test

### How it works
After installing Sedy on your repository, just type a sed-like command (`s/[old text]/[new text]/`) in a single comment or in a code review, and Sedy will quickly commit the fix.


# Installation

### On your repositories
Log into the [Sedy Installer](https://marmelab.com/sedy/) with your GitHub account and click on your repositories.

### On your repositories (manually)

- Add a webhook to your repository with these informations:

| Input     | Value                          |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
|Payload URL| https://sedy.marmelab.com      |
|Scopes     | `Pull request review comment`  |

- Invite [sedy-bot](https://github.com/sedy-bot) user as a collaborator.

That's it.
